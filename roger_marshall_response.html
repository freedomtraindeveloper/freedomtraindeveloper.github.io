Furthermore, we try to understand the upsides, the downsides, and the unintended consequences of each bill. We do our best to evaluate every issue we are contacted about through these themes.</span></p>

            Dear Roger Marshall:<br>
            <br>
        </span>
    </p><p>
        <span face="&#39;Times New Roman&#39;" color="#000000" style="font-size:14pt">Thank you for your response concerning bringing back the <i>American Freedom Train</i> and for being willing to support this cause. I believe that if this dream becomes a reality, it will help raise a sense of patriotism among its citizens. I also believe that it will help our young people realize the sacrifices that our Founding Fathers made in order to establish the country that we call the United States of America.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span face="&#39;Times New Roman&#39;" style="font-size:14pt"></span><span face="&#39;Times New Roman&#39;" style="font-size:14pt">I particularly think that we should work on making this proposed event materialize into a reality, especially in this day and age. With the dissension seen between political parties and social groups, and the love for this country beginning to wane, we should work on bringing about this event, which can serve as a reminder that all sides, throughout the years, have played a part in making the USA the great nation that it is today. This is the reason why I have the desire for this event to take place.</span></p>
    <p>
        <span face="&#39;Times New Roman&#39;" style="font-size:14pt">I again thank you for being willing to consider and discuss with your staff about bringing back the <i>American Freedom Train</i> for the 250th anniversary of America. I'm looking forward to working with you more on this matter.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span face="&#39;Times New Roman&#39;" style="font-size:14pt">Let's work together to make this happen again!</span>
