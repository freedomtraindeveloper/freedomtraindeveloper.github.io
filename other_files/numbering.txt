Numbering Questions That Have Been Written

1. Number the plagues in the order that they come
2. Order these excerpts of the Ten Commandments in order
3. Order these events in the right order (can be used over and over with different events, so go right ahead and use it until the form says otherwise)

PS: These questions can be repeated two times.
